Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at Halmstad University in Sweden, working within the Center for Applied and Intelligent Systems Research (CAISR). I am currently in the final stages of my doctoral studies, aiming to complete them in January 2025.

My primary research focus is on enhancing the generalization abilities of machine learning models through meta-learning. By exploring how models can learn to learn, my work aims to develop algorithms that perform well across a wide range of tasks with limited data. I believe this is a key focus in advancing deep learning models to better mimicking the human learning abilities.

In addition to meta-learning, my research interests include few-shot learning, continual learning, self-supervised learning, and in-context learning. I am also passionate about several practical applications of meta-learning, particularly in the healthcare and robotics domain.
